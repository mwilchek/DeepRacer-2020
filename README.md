# AWS DeepRacer for re:Invent 2020

This is an informal log of my exploration of [AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) training.  My best iteration was submitted for the AWS 2020 re:Invent DeepRacer Competition. All of the work was also submitted as a final project for a graduate Cloud Computing course for the M.S. Data Science program at George Washington University.
